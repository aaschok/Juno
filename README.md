# Magnetometer/Particle Data Graph
A python script for collecting magnetometer data and jade particle data between two given dates from csv tables and DAT tables and graphing them in a specified time windows. Each graph is saved to a folder for review.

graphanalyze.py and graphanalyzeCopy.py are similar with the former being outdated and on my to do list to remove and make graphanalyzeCopy.py the only graph analyzeing script.
